# Livesplit plugin: Automatic Split Screenshots

This is a plugin for LiveSplit that takes a screenshot of your splits automatically when a run ends. The screenshot image is saved by default into the LiveSplit folder - you can change the folder in the settings (note: use a trailing folder separator, e.g. d:/stuff/screenshots/)
