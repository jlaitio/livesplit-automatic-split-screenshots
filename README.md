# Livesplit plugin: Automatic Split Screenshots

This is a plugin for LiveSplit that takes a screenshot of your splits automatically when a run ends. The screenshot image is saved by default into the LiveSplit folder - you can change the folder in the settings (note: use a trailing folder separator, e.g. d:/stuff/screenshots/)

## Usage

* Copy `SplitScreenshotLibrary.dll` from the `Release` folder to your `LiveSplit/Components` folder
* Restart LiveSplit if it's running
* Edit your LiveSplit layout and add "Automatic Split Screenshots" under "Other"
* Optionally edit the output folder in your layout settings under the "Automatic Split Screenshots" tab
